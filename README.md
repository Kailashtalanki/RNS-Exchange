# RNS-Exchange

This repository contains the source code for a mobile application developed using React Native. The purpose of this app is to address the problem of wasted and underutilized resources among students. The app serves as a platform for students to communicate and effectively share various resources, such as textbooks, class notes, calculators, clothing, and more.

## Problem Statement

Currently, many valuable resources are being thrown away or left unused by students. These resources are not only expensive but also have the potential to benefit other students. The existing solutions, such as the barter system or purchasing new items, have limitations. Lack of communication among students of different age groups and branches further exacerbates the problem, leading to wastage of useful resources.

## Proposed Solution

To overcome the limitations of existing solutions, the proposed system is an app developed using React Native. Since most students have smartphones nowadays, this app acts as a bridge, facilitating effective communication and resource sharing among students. The key features and functionalities of the app include:

- User registration
- Resource listing and categorization
- In-app messaging system for communication between users
- Exchanges between users on their will

## Getting Started

To run the app locally and contribute to its development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
